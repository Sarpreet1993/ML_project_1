# Calorie Counter - Machine Learning Project

This project is a regression-based machine learning model that predicts the number of calories burned during exercise based on input features. Built using Python in Jupyter Notebook, the model utilizes two datasets: `calories.csv` and `exercise.csv`.

## 🧠 Objective

The main objective of this project is to develop a predictive model using regression to estimate the number of calories burned during exercise based on various physical parameters.

## 📊 Datasets

- **`calories.csv`**: Contains the target variable – the number of calories burned.
- **`exercise.csv`**: Contains feature variables such as age, gender, height, weight, duration, heart rate, and body temperature.

These datasets are merged based on a common identifier to form a single DataFrame for training and evaluation.

## 🔍 Features Used

- Age
- Gender
- Height
- Weight
- Duration
- Heart Rate
- Body Temperature

## 🛠️ Technologies & Libraries

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib / Seaborn (for visualization)
- Scikit-learn (for preprocessing, model building, and evaluation)

## ⚙️ Model

A regression model was used for prediction. The steps include:

1. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**: Merging datasets, handling missing values, encoding categorical variables.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizing distributions and correlations.
3. **Model Training**: Training a regression model (e.g., Linear Regression, RandomForestRegressor).
4. **Evaluation**: Evaluating model performance using metrics such as MAE, MSE, and R² score.

## ✅ Results

The final model showed [insert R² score or any other metric], indicating [brief description of performance].
